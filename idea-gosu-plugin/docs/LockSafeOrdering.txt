1. The PSI lock must be acquired before the type system lock. This is because IDEA calls our
   code with the PSI lock acquired and we may call the type system.

    Example from GosuLanguageInjector/

    synchronized (PsiLock.LOCK) {
      TypeSystem.lock();
      try {
        ... stuff ...
      } finally {
        TypeSystem.unlock();
      }
    }
